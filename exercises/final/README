# Final Project Game

## Gameplay Description

##### The "core mechanic" of the game will be based on the story. Story segments will lead the player character into
##### different scenarios in which the goal will change between stages. For example, the first part of the story will
##### lead the player character into breaking into a villain's lair. In this first segment, the player will be put into
##### an auto-scroller and will be tasked with sneaking around while avoiding getting caught. Soon after, the following
##### story segments will play a role in determining the type of game that the player will enter.

## Input

##### The inputs will range depending on the game. For example, as the first game mentioned will involve the player
##### character sneaking around, the inputs would naturally be either the arrow keys or WASD. Games that follow might
##### have additional input options such as mouse clicks, but that will ultimately depend on where the story is taken.

## Visual Style

##### Given the theming of the game, I'll try to make the environments fit depending on the scene. For example,
##### if the player character is inside the evil lair, the aesthetic should probably be futuristic of sorts.
##### Somewhat like Dr. Wily's Fortress as an example. Meanwhile, if the player character is outside, it might
##### be a good idea to make it gloomy or make a scene in which the area appears to be in a state of panic. Perhaps
##### something like sirens and flashing lights could reflect that.

## Audio Style

##### The audio style will be dependent on each segment of the game. For example, if one game involves sneaking around,
##### then the audio would most likely reflect something that sounds tense and low as opposed to something more excitable.
##### However, I also like to take preferences into account when choosing audio for my projects, so the music chosen may
##### not necessarily be the best choice, but good enough to where it's not distracting from the main game.

## Interface Sketches

##### The UI will most likely be based on the profession of the main character. As of this time, I have an idea of what type
##### of profession the player character will have, but nothing concrete. Perhaps the main character will be a ninja or even
##### batman-esque.

## Story/Theme

##### The story/theme of the game will be fairly simple: Stop the villain from detonating a bomb. The idea is that the
##### main character is alerted of what might potentially occur if the villain gets his way. So, the main character is
##### tasked with breaking into the evil lair, locating the bomb, and disarming it. There may be other story segments
##### to make it more fleshed out, but it's not very deep and should suffice as a plot.


# Goals of the Project

## The "Low-Bar"

##### The low-bar of the assignment would at least make it so there are at least two minigames available for the player
##### to enjoy. If I have to cut any of the minigames, it would potentially be the second one where the player would
##### normally be tasked to roam around an open environment, looking for a way to enter a locked room.

## Target Goal

##### I would like to get at least three minigames completed. This would make the entire game feel cohesive and more
##### enjoyable as a result. Moreover, if I can add more story elements and dialogue options, then I feel as if I would
##### be more than happy with the project.

## Desired High-Bar

##### The desired high-bar of the project would be to have it so there are five or more minigames along with more story
##### and character development. The extra minigames would give me an opportunity to flesh out the story and characters
##### more outside of the basic "stop bad guy" trope.

# Timeline Needed

##### From the time of this README, there is roughly about three weeks until the final submission of this project. Currently,
##### I am tasked with several other projects that require my full attention. Some of them can be completed as early as next
##### week if I pace out my assignments correctly. However, one of them is a group project, so the timing on that one will
##### ultimately depend on everyone's contributions. That being said, I feel that beyond the projects and couple of finals
##### that I have at the end of the semester, I should have more than enough time to at least meet the targetted goal.
##### If later into the semester proves much more difficult, I will adjust my targetted goal accordingly.



Notes to Self:

- Dodging several incoming objects on a moving platform. 
- Sneaking around an area with moving NPCs.
- Exploration inside the evil lair.
- Puzzle solving minigame involving grids of 2x2, 3x3, and 5x5.
- Escape minigame where the main character must exit the lair before the time limit ends.
