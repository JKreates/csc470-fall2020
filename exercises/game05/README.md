# Micro-Design Document

#### As the assignment involves the use of a mouse and user interface elements, I was thinking of creating a small
#### mystery game in which the player has to investigate several people to solve a mystery. Similarly to Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney,
#### the player will be able to question, investigate, and potentially present evidence. Once the player has a solid idea of
#### who the culprit is, they will be able to take a guess. If they are correct, they win. If they are wrong, they lose. I might try
#### and see if it's possible to swap around information between NPCs, but if I cannot, I'll make sure to flesh out the one case as 
#### much as possible. 

# What I Need To Implement

⋅⋅* How will NPCs react to specific questions?

⋅⋅* Will there be a visual cue that gives the player a hint?

⋅⋅* How many tries will the player get before it is game over?

⋅⋅* Can there be a limit as to how many times a player can question an NPC?

⋅⋅* How will evidence be stored and used in the game?

⋅⋅* Will there be a log of potentially important messages said from NPCs?

⋅⋅* When will the player be able to make an accusation?

⋅⋅* Will there be a time limit before the final judgment can be made?

⋅⋅* Will it all occur in one singular scene or will there be multiple?

⋅⋅* If there are multiple scenes, how will evidence and logs be carried over?

⋅⋅* How will players be able to review evidence and logs?
